/// A FIFO-to-READY/VALID buffer is a highly specialized two element FIFO backed with a pair
/// of registers instead of a BRAM.  The idea is to allow two pipelines to be joined
/// where the supply side pipeline has "push" semantics (meaning that it is triggered
/// by some other process and produces data elements at it's own pace) and the demand
/// side pipeline has "pull" semantics - meaning that it is triggered at some rate that
/// moderates consumption of the data elements.
///
/// The other way to conceptualize this is as a source and sink pair.  The supply side
/// pipeline is a data source - it produces data elements at it's own pace.  The demand
/// side pipeline is a data sink - it consumes data elements at it's own pace.  The push
/// pull buffer in general would be a FIFO, and indeed the Carloni papers show FIFOs as
/// the implementation of push-pull buffers.  However, in many cases, we only need minimal
/// buffering, and a pair of registers is sufficient.  
///
/// Note that a normal synchronous FIFO as included in `rhdl` will not work here - if it has
/// only two slots in it, it cannot (by design) fill both slots.
///
/// The design of the buffer uses a state to manage the fill level, and uses the extra
/// value of a fill level of 3 to indicate that the push-pull buffer is in an error condition
/// due to either overflow of the input.  To make this buffer easy to use with Carloni
/// skid buffers, the output is presented as an `Option<T>`, and underflow is not possible,
/// as `None` is returned when the buffer is empty.
